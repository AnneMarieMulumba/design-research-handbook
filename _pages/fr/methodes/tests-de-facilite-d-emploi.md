### What is usability testing?
Usability testing is asking people to complete tasks and observing what happens.

### Key elements of usability testing
* **Make a plan.**  Write down the purpose, participants and tasks before your start. [Sample one page usability testing plan](https://www.userfocus.co.uk/pdf/usabilitydashboard.pdf)
* **Recruit enough people.** Don't test with one or two people and call it done. Use at least five different people of different backgrounds. [More thoughts on how many people to include.](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/01/how-to-determine-the-right-number-of-participants-for-usability-studies.php)
* **Choose tasks that people would actually think to complete.** For example, on the CDS website, people think "I want to use the job application function." Instead, they'd think of themselves as "learning about what jobs CDS has available." [Task writing tips](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/better-usability-tasks/)
* **While facilitating tests, be quiet.** Ask participants to complete a task and then be silent. Don't coach them or react to what they do. Focus on observing what's easy and hard. [Tips on what to say when people ask you questions.](http://sensible.com/downloads/things-a-therapist-would-say.pdf)
* **Look for patterns across participants.** Don't start making changes based on one participant. Fix what several people struggle with. Two possible tools for doing so: [the rainbow spreadsheet](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/rainbow-spreadsheet-collaborative-ux-research-tool/) and the [rolling issues list](http://usabilityworks.com/consensus-on-observations-in-real-time-keeping-a-rolling-list-of-issues/)

### Tips for conducting usability testing at CDS
* Follow our [guidelines for respecting participants' privacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy). Work with our policy team to create an ATIP-approved consent form before you get started. Speak to the policy analyst on your product team or ask Colin for more help.
* Interviewing as part of user research is generally exempt from [Government of Canada Public Opinion Research regulation](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/public-opinion-research-government.html#toc3). But follow [our POR tips]({{ site.baseurl }}/por) to steer clear of potential problems.
* You can use our [equipment]({{ site.baseurl}}/research-kit) and/or [listening room]({{ site.baseurl }}/research-room) for usability testing.
