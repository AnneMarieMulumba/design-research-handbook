"Public opinion research" (POR) is a class of primary research regulated by the Government of Canada. If government agencies conduct POR, they need to follow the POR processes described in the [Directive on the Management of Communications](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30682).

As the ["Defining public opinion research"](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/public-opinion-research-government.html#h-1) guidance states:

>> User research that involves only using observation techniques and collecting fact-based information is normally not considered public opinion research. 

>> Behavioural research is generally defined as how people react or behave in a given situation. Factual research often answers who, what, when or where.

Most of our research focuses on people's behaviours or past actions. That research is factual and behavioural, so it doesn't fall within the definition of POR.
It's possible to construct design research that is POR. If you ask questions about people's opinions policy or government, you may be doing POR. 

If you don't know whether your research is POR or not, speak to our policy team.
