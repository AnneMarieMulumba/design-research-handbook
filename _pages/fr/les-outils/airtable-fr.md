*We use Airtable to track key data about the studies we run.*

### How to get to Airtable
- Visit [our research studies base](https://airtable.com/shrlghN7jPJCj7lbf).
- If you need to be able to edit records, ask Colin for an invitation.

### What we put on Airtable
Airtable is where we track basic details about what research we conduct where. For each study, we collect information about:
- The product and research question
- The number of participants
- A breakdown of participants by primary language, use of assistive technology, etc.
- Which team members take part in the research

### What we don't put on Airtable
- Anything that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
    - Research participant rosters (including names, email addresses, phone numbers)
    - Raw research notes
    - Research session recordings
    - Job interviewee notes or evaluations
    - Store this information in [GCDocs]({{site.baseurl}}/gc-docs) or our [secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/protected-files). 
- We don't track internal projects on Airtable. Instead, put those projects on [Trello]({{site.baseurl}}/trello).

### Why do we do this?
Airtable serves three purposes:
- It keeps us abreast of each others work. It saves Colin and others from asking what you're doing, when.
- We use it tochecke against our progress on [our key results]({{site.baseurl}}/vision-objectives).
- It helps us answer basic, statistical questions about our work, like "How many people did you speak with?"
