### 5 keys to interviewing

Colin, October 16


### 1. Asking productive questions.

**What about restating what they just said?**

Useful for giving yourself some time. Maybe awkward for the participant. Remember people may agree with you no matter what you say.

**Where you're working with someone who's not comfortable with open ended narratives…**

Giving them a structure or example. What you're expecting in terms of content and detail. 


### 2. Listening (the "rapport engine").



*   Ask your question and then stop.
*   Maintain eye contact and open body language. (Thoughtfully.)
*   Demonstrate you're listening.
    *   Follow up, follow-up, follow up.
    *   "Earlier you said that…"
    *   "I want to go back to what you said earlier."
*   Be selective about body language and subtle sounds.
*   Be selective about self-disclosure and mini statements.
*   Monitoring when and where you use body language cues. Using them consistently.
*   Avoiding interrupting.** **Let there be a little bit of silence. Adjust based on participant behavior. Give yourself enough time. 


### 3. Manage the flow.



*   Progress between phases:
    *   Warming up
    *   Establishing the basics
    *   Diving deeper
    *   Key questions
    *   Summing up
    *   Reflecting and verifying
*   When you're changing topic, say so.
*   Let participants be winding and pick up disparate threads later
*   What if participants misunderstand the question (or we mis-ask the question)? Make it clear mistakes are your's. See if they answer your question naturally.
*   Let participants know what your goal/arc for the session is.
*   Give people an out if they get uncomfortable.
*   Give people an opportunity to ask their own questions as well. Those questions can be really revealing.


### 4. Don't only ask questions.

_Instead, ask people to:_



*   Complete tasks.
*   Get reactions to a sketch, website or objects.
*   Sequence cards or sticky notes that represent their experience.
*   Write down a few key points.
*   Give people the option to use other tools to share their answer. Projective techniques for vulnerable audiences and complicated topics.
*   Follow people in their world, instead of yours. Don't ask questions at all.
*   Following your gut when you things go off the rails. 


### 5. Look for patterns, not outliers.



*   Use as close to verbatim notes as you can.
*   Focus on what you heard most frequently, not what was most interesting.
*   Talk about the diversity of answers, not just the most memorable one.
*   Come to conclusions, then analyze again.
*   Don't analyze alone.
