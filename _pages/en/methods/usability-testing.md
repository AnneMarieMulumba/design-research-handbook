### What is usability testing?
Usability testing is observing people use a website (or other tool) while they complete tasks with it.

### Tips for conducting usability testing at CDS
* Follow our guidelines for respecting participants' privacy. In particular, you need to work with our policy team to create a study-specific consent form before you get started. Speak to the policy analyst on your product team or ask Colin for more help.
* Usability testing is generally exempt from Government of Canada Public Opinion Research regulation. But follow our POR tips to steer clear of potential problems.
* You can use our equipment and/or listening room to conduct testing.
