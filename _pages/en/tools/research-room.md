*You can use the research room at our Ottawa office to host interviews or usability tests.*

### Where is the room?
It's room 14134, the small room near the outreach team.

### What's in the room?
For interviewing:
 - Two comfy chairs
 - A small laptop or coffee table

For usability testing:
 - A work table
 - Two fixed chairs
 - Devices for testing

All of our [research equipment]({{site.baseurl}}/research-kit) is also stored in the room.

### How do I get members of the public to the room?
- You must register them in advance with security. Visit the visitor registration form on your TBS computer a least a day before your visit.
- You must meet your guest at reception downstairs. They'll have trouble navigating the building without your help.

### How do I reserve the room?
You can reserve the room in Google Calendar, like other conference rooms.
