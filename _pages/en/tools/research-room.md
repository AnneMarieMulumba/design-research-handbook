### You can use the dedicated research room at our Ottawa headquarters to host interviews or usability tests.

### Where is the room?
It's room 14134, the small room near the communications team.

### What's in the room?
- For interviewing:
	- Two comfy chairs
	- A small laptop or coffee table
- For usability testing:
	- A work table
	- Two fixed chairs
All of our research equipment is also stored in the room.

### How do I get members of the public to the room?
- You must register them in advance with security. Visit the visitor registration form on your TBS computer a least a day before your visit.
- You must meet your guest at reception downstairs. They'll have trouble navigating the building without your help.

### How do I reserve the room?
You can reserve the room in Google Calendar, like other conference rooms.
