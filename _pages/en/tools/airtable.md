### We use Airtable to track key data about the studies we run.

### How to get to Airtable
- Colin will send you an invitation
- Click on "Team Drives" and then "CDS Research - Recherche." Or this (link brings you directly to the research drive)[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ANCzQfZxlMUkUk9PVA].

### What we put on Google Drive
Documents we want to work on together, including:
- Community meeting presentations

### What we don't put on Google Drive
Anything that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
- Research participant rosters (including names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Raw research notes
- Research session recordings
- Job interviewee notes or evaluations
All of this information should be stored in [GCDocs]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy) or our [Secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/secure-filing). 

### Tips for using Google Drive
- Files stored in our drive are only accessible to researchers and system administrators. If you want others to see your files, make sure to share them.
- Files stored in your personal "drive" are not accessible to anyone else by default.
- Some product-specific team drives are accessible to people in our partner agencies. Ask you product team who can see the files in its team drive.
