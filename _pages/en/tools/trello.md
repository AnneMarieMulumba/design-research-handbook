### We use Trello to track internal projects.

### How to get to Trello
- Log into Trello via your CDS Google account.
- View our (Airtable base for research)[https://trello.com/b/k8wdSP3W/research-community-projects].

### What we put on Airtable
Airtable is where we track basic details about what research we conduct where. For each study, we collect information about:
- The product and research question
- The number of participants
- A breakdown of participants by their primary language, use of assistive technology, etc.
- Which team members participate in the research

### Who uses Airtable when
- **Researchers are responsible for adding their studies Airtable as they start to plan them.**
- Enter studies as you start planning them.
- Move studies to the "Planning and conducting" column when you start conducting them.
- Move them to the "Analyzing" column when you're there.
- Colin will check Airtable for completeness every week or so.

### Why do we do this?
Airtable serves three purposes:
- It keeps us abreast of eachothers work. It saves Colin and others from incessantly asking what you're doing, when.
- We use it to evaluate against our progress on [our key results]
- It helps us answer basic questions about our research operation in aggregate. For example, we're often asked "How many people did you talk to about government services this year?" With this tool, we can keep good track.

### What we don't put on Airtable
- Like Google Drive, Airtable can't hold [protected data]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy). Instead, store this information in [GCDocs]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy) or our [Secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/secure-filing). 
- We don't track internal projects (like writing documentation, or maintaining this handbook) on Airtable. Instead, put those projects on [Secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/secure-filing).
