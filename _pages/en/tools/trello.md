*We use Trello to track research team internal projects.*

### How to find Trello
- Log into Trello via your CDS Google account.
- View our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/k8wdSP3W/research-community-projects).
- If you need to be able to edit cards, ask Colin for an invitation.

### What we put on Trello
Trello is where we track basic information about ongoing, *non-product-specific projects*. We track information like: 
- The name of the project (example: "updating the consent form generator")
- Who's taking the lead on it
- Notes on project progress

### What we don't put on Trello
Like Google Drive or Airtable, Trello can't hold [protected data]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy). Store this information in [GCDocs]({{site.baseurl}}/gc-docs) or our [secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/protected-files). 

### Who uses Trello when
- **Researchers are responsible for updating their project cards.**
- Enter projects as you start working on them.
- Update the project card as you do work on the project.
- Move it to the "done" column when you're done with it.
- Colin will check Airtable for completeness every week or so.

### Why do we do this?
Trello serves three purposes:
- It keeps us abreast of each others work. It saves Colin and others from asking what you're doing, when.
- We use it to check against our progress on [our key results]
