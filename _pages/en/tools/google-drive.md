*We use Google Drive to store research team documents.*

### How to get to Google Drive
- Log into Google Drive via your CDS Google account.
- Click on "Team Drives" and then "CDS Research - Recherche." Or this [link brings you directly to the research drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0ANCzQfZxlMUkUk9PVA).

### What we put on Google Drive
Google Drive is where we store non-protected documents like:
- Community meeting presentations
- Document templates
- Notes from important meetings

### What we don't put on our Google Drive
- Anything that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
    - Research participant rosters (including names, email addresses, phone numbers)
    - Raw research notes
    - Research session recordings
    - Job interviewee notes or evaluations
    - Store this information in [GCDocs]({{site.baseurl}}/gc-docs) or our [secure filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/secure-filing).
- Don't put product-specific research plans in the research Google Drive folder. Instead, put it in the Google Drive folder related to your product.

### Why do we do this?
Google Drive makes it easy for us to see and collaborate on each other's documents. If we store documents on our computers, it can be hard for others to find them in the future.
