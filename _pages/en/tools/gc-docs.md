Any digital material that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
- Research participant rosters (including names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Raw research notes

- Store protected papers in our [locked filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/protected-files).
- Classified (like "secret" or "topic secret" documents) can't go in any of our systems or filing cabinets. Refer to TBS' guidance on handling it.
