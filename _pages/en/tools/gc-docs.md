### We put files with protected personal information on GCDocs.

### How can I access GCDocs?
- On your TBS computer, double click the "GCDOCS" icon on your desktop.
- If you're not on the TBS network, you will have to connect to the VPN before your open GCDOCs.

### What we put in GCDOCs
Any digital material that's [protected information]({{site.baseurl}}/privacy), including:
- Research participant rosters (including names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Raw research notes
- Research session recordings
- Job interviewee notes or evaluations

### Who uses GCDOCs when
- **You are responsible for storing all files with protected information on your TBS computer.**
- Be careful not to inadvertantly store participant or research data on your MacBook.

### Why do we do this?
We have a serious responsibility to connect any information that can be connected directly back to research participants. Even if its a hassle, locking materials away helps keep them in the right hands.

### What we don't put in GCDocs
- Any non-protected files, like research plans or reports, can go on [Google Drive]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive).
- You can store protected paper in our [locked filing cabinet]({{site.baseurl}}/locked-filing-cabinet).
- Classified (e.g. secret, top secret or other national interest documents) can't go in any of our systems or filing cabinets. Refer to TBS' guidance on handling classified information for more guidance on where to store it.
