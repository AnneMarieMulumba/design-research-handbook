### Goals of research critique sessions

* Improve our research skills and outputs. Both feedback givers and receivers should learn from critique. 
* Practice and model professional feedback giving. We have to give feedback to other product team members often. Critique provides a structured opportunity to practice that skill.

### Critique session agenda

Critique group agendas vary. One common approach:

Break the hour into two, half hour sessions. Focus each half hour on a different person’s work. It could be a research plan, session materials, analysis or deliverable.

During each half hour:
* **The recipient introduces their research plan, session materials, analysis or deliverable.** The researcher should provide enough context that other participants can provide useful feedback. Walk through:
  * the goals of the product
  * the research questions of your current research
  * particular goals of your plan, materials, analysis or deliverables
  * any limitations recipients should keep in mind
* **The recipient poses the question they want to guide a critique.** That question could be something like:
  * “How can I accomplish my goal better?”
  * “How can I get over this particular problem?”
  * “What might the risks be of this approach?”
  * “Is my team’s concern with this method justified?”
* **The givers ask clarifying questions.** Before givers start advising, they ask questions to test their assumptions.
* **The givers, humbly, offer potential answers to the recipient’s guiding question.** Phrase your answers as questions, like “Would it be helpful to…” or “Have you tried?”
* **The recipient sums up what they’ve heard.** And offers thanks for the feedback.


### Ground rules
* Recipients and givers should be humble, respectful and kind. Critique isn’t the time to flaunt your knowledge, push a personal agenda or be crabby. We set our team’s feedback culture during critique. I expect you to be at your most thoughtful.
* For givers:
  * Do ask questions. Lots of questions. Try to understand what people have done before, why and how. Try to understand why your suggestion isn’t a good idea.
  * Don’t make edicts. You might have a better idea, but you shouldn’t issue orders to other people.
* For recipients:
  * Do keep an open mind. Believe others might have a better idea than you do.
  * Don’t be defensive. Your goal is to learn from others, not to defend your existing decisions. 
* Watch your body language. 
  * Receiving critique makes most people feel vulnerable. Givers should be encouraging and warm. 
  * On the flip side, it’s hard to give honest feedback. Recipients should also encourage and thank givers.
