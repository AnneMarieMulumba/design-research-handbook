# Translation

## Isn’t Google Translate enough?
* Machines do not (yet) understand cultural references, humour, etc.
* Humans are needed to correct linguistic and cultural accuracy.
* Talk to Text - not that great either!

## When translating consider the... 
* Region of text
* Education level of the speaker
* Speaker’s tone and degree of formality
* What to do with acronyms, language-specific words.

Consider if...
* You want to keep “Ums” and “Likes”
* When you can summarize what was said.
* How much time you have.

Not all native speakers can translate both ways.
