Welcome! 
Before you begin research at CDS, there are some things to be aware of when doing user research in government and at Treasury Board. This guide outlines resources, processes, and questions that will guide you through a study in a way that is ethical, legal, compliant with policies and regulations, and consistent. 
This guide is a work in progress – if you have any questions please contact a member of the policy or research team.
This derives from a meeting between Policy x Research that took place December 2018 - the results can be found here.

Ensures that laws and policies conform to their own and established research ethics

Basic Privacy & Consent Guidelines
New to the team?
Before you get started with any research activities at CDS, take some time to read through the following questions and answers. For all research activities you undertake, you will need to be aware of the following: 
What privacy and consent documents do I need to do [insert type] of research?
If doing intercept interviews, you will need a consent form and a privacy statement.
If also recording the participant, you will need an additional consent form.
If recruiting via an intermediary (e.g. an individual or an organization finds potential participants for CDS), the recruiter will need to provide consent to CDS to act as a recruiter (e.g. via an email), and they will need consent forms and privacy statements to distribute to potential participants.

Which email do I use for recruitment?
Your @tbs-sct.gc.ca email. Personal information is Protected and must remain on your TBS devices (tablets, @tbs-sct.gc.ca email, work-issued phones). We know this isn’t ideal – we’re working on it.

On what devices can I record information?
You can use your TBS phones for audio recording. Use the voice notes feature in the encrypted container portion of your phone (if it has one – chat with a member of the policy team for more information).
Be sure to send the recording to your TBS tablet, not MacBook, to listen and store. Only once it’s transcribed can it go on a MacBook. Again, not ideal, but we’re working on it.

How should I save participant information + org information?
Participant information should be stored on TBS devices.

You can use your MacBooks and CDS email accounts for outreach with organizations, but as soon as you’re exchanging personal information you should use your TBS devices. It’s safer just to stick to TBS devices and accounts.


What is considered protected data?
Generally speaking, anything with personal information in it should be treated as protected.


WHERE should data be stored? Macbook? Tablet?
Store all protected data on your TBS tablet. Don’t send it (e.g. via an email) outside of the TBS system. 


How long do I need to hold on to consent forms?
We should hold on to consent forms for as long as we’re using the data from those research sessions. As a rough rule, that would be until the end of CDS’s involvement with a product.

Retaining a consent form is extra important if it allows the participant to withdraw their consent after the research. (e.g., if the research was confidential.) 


Where should I retain consent forms? (physical vs digital)
Digital privacy and consent forms should be stored on your TBS tablet.

Physical privacy and consent forms should be stored in the research locker in the CDS office (ask a researcher for the code). 


How do I dispose of data? Consent forms? Notes?
Data recorded on paper (e.g. consent forms, hand-written notes) should be shredded using the shredders in the office’s printer rooms. (Fun fact: those shredders are RCMP-approved!)


Who can have access to research data?
This depends on the collection authority under which the data was collected.
If the privacy statement only includes TBS’s authority (“authorized by the Financial Administration Act”), then only TBS employees (CDS, essentially) can view it until the information is depersonalized (anonymized).
If the privacy statement includes both TBS’s and the partner’s collection authority (e.g., “authorized by the Financial Administration Act and the Department of Veterans Affairs Act”), then both TBS employees and employees of the partner department can view the data.

Who in a partner department can view data?
As long as the partner’s collection authority is included, any employee in the partner department could view it. That said, we must limit that sharing to employees who have a valid reason to access and handle that data, as it contains personal information.

Can other staff at CDS view data? Other members of the product team? 

The same guidelines apply here as they do for who in a partner department can view the data. With TBS’s collection authority, any TBS employee could view it, but we must limit that sharing to those with a valid reason.

These constraints apply to raw data. Summary data (where no insights or observations could be identified with an individual) can be shared openly.

Can a partner send personal information to a CDS researcher? (e.g. a spreadsheet with immigration application information)
A partner cannot send us an unsolicited spreadsheet with personal information. We would need to make sure we have the legal authority to collect the personal information. In order to share data between a partner and CDS, when the data was collected it would need both the partner and TBS’s collection authority, and the data would need to have been included in one of the standard personal information banks, like PSU 938 “Outreach”.

What can I digitize from paper notes? Where can I store that digitized information?
Paper notes can be fully digitized through manual transcription or through the TBS network scanners (not the ones that connect to our MacBooks).
Store digitized notes on your TBS devices. If you’d to share them with other researchers or other members of your team, you can email their TBS accounts or store the notes in GCDocs. 

If I want to take digital notes, where I can I store that?
If taking digital notes, use your TBS devices (TBS-issued phone, in the secure section, or your tablet).

Readings
These readings cover much of the language used when writing consent and privacy forms alongside Policy Team members. If possible, read these prior to beginning any research to familiarize yourself with language and policies.

The Privacy Act: Governs how the federal government handles personal information. 
Section 3: Definitions
Section 4: Authority to Collect
Section 8 (2): Appropriate Disclosure of Information

Tri-council policy statement on Ethical Conduct for research w/ humans: Core principles which outline best practices for conducting research with participants. Chapter 3 provides guidelines for collecting informed consent. 
Chapter 3: Consent

Directive on Privacy Practices: Provides direction to government institutions on how to implement effective privacy practices.
(see CDS summary)
Section 6: Requirements

In-house tools
These tools have been developed by the policy team to make privacy and consent gathering more efficient and safe. You will use them in partnership with the policy team. 

Research Activity Privacy Guide
When to use: As soon as you have decided where and who to research, complete this form to the best of your ability and share with policy. 

Privacy and Consent Framework for Notices
When to use: When choosing which privacy and consent notices to use. 

Privacy and Consent form Generator
When to use: In partnership with policy to design privacy and consent forms that are easily readable by the general public. 

Keywords and Acronyms
A more complete set of definitions can be found in the Privacy and Consent Framework.
PII

Personally Identifiable Information
Any single data element that identifies a specific individual. Any information that can be used to distinguish one person from another and can be used for de-anonymizing anonymous data can be considered PII. 
ATIP

Access to Information and Privacy
The Access to Information Act gives every Canadian citizen, permanent resident, individual or corporation in Canada the right to request access to records that are under the control of federal government institutions, regardless of their format. The Treasury Board Secretariat ATIP office reviews our privacy and consent notices. 
PIB

Personal Information Bank
Descriptions of personal information under the control of a government institution that is organized and retrievable by an individual's name or by a number, symbol or other element that identifies that individual.
Confidential
A level of confidentiality. Confidential data are usually coded: the subject is assigned a unique identifier that will be used to identify the data.(E.g., “respondent 1”)
Anonymous
A level of confidentiality. Anonymous data are recorded so that the information can never be linked to the subject who supplied it.
Anonymized or Depersonalized
A level of confidentiality. Anonymized or depersonalized data is initially collected with the identity of the participat known. Then undergoes a rigorous process to remove identifying information such that no single element or combination of data could be used to identify the individual. 
Protected Information
Applies to information or assets that, if compromised, could reasonably be expected to cause injury to a non-national interest—that is, an individual interest such as a person or an organization.
