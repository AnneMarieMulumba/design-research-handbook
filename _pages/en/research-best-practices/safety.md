_Not rules, but suggestions to consider as you’re planning research._

### Planning
- Develop a research plan outlining the user group, ethical considerations, going over tri-council policy - privacy, consent, risks, benefits, research team + responsibilities - socialize this with your team prior.
- Determine the controls required to manage the risk to an acceptable level.
- Research the user group / context before conducting fieldwork - dress code, language, props or things you’ll need for fieldwork.
- Protect personal information (your own, just as you would a participant's)
- Arrange for appropriate transportation to and from the site.

### Before you head out
- Don’t research without a buddy (both in-office & in-field). 
- Taking a research guidance 101 session with your team - taking their questions and concerns.
- Discuss any concerns you have regarding your safety with teammates. 

### During the session
- Make your role clear to the participant, make their role clear (as possible) as well.
- Communicate your expectations and limitations very clearly to participants. What is not needed from them? What actions are unnecessary and unsafe?
- Make sure the participant knows they can leave or refuse to answer questions Similarly, do not feel obligated to answer all questions from participants.
- Stay in communication with the people managing the space you’re in (where applicable).
- Have a way of discretely communicating that you’re uncomfortable to your team (e.g. codewords).

### Afterwards
- Check yourself after fieldwork - how are you feeling? Do you need some time off - was it too heavy? etc.

### Just in case
- Tell someone where you’re going before you leave.
- Know how to contact security or police in your location.
