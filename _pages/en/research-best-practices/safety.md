_Not rules, but suggestions to consider as you’re planning research._

### Planning
- Include ethical and safety considerations in your research plan
- Do some research into your participant group before you start recruiting. Where do they live? What are their norms?
- Protect personal information (your own, just liki you would a participant's)
- Arrange for appropriate transportation to and from the site.

### Before you head out
- Don’t research without a buddy (both in-office and in-field). 
- Do a research 101 session with your team. Listen to their questions and concerns so they can be more comfortable in the field.
- Discuss any concerns you have about your safety with teammates.
 
### During the session
- Make your role clear to the participant.
- Communicate your expectations and limitations clearly. Is there anything you *don't* want participants to do?
- Make sure the participant knows they can leave or refuse to answer questions anytime.
- Similarly, do not feel obligated to answer all questions from participants.
- Stay in communication with the people managing the space you’re in (where applicable).
- Have a way of discretely communicating that you’re uncomfortable to your team, like a "codeword".

### Afterwards
Check in with yourself after fieldwork. How are you feeling? Do you need some time off?

### Just in case
- Tell someone where you’re going before you leave.
- Know how to contact security or police in your location.
