### Conduct research through all phases of product development.
Research isn't confined to one phase of product development. And each phase of product development should include more than one research study. For example:
* Discovery could include observations, interviews, secondary literature review or other background data gathering.
* Alpha could include prototype testing, usability testing or larger scale usability testing.
* Beta could include repeated usability testing, A/B testing or analytics analysis.

### There's no simple guideline for how often research should happen.
How often should you usability test in alpha and beta? How often should you conduct interviews in discovery? There is no simple answer to these questions. Instead, balance the following considerations.

### Speed up enough that you can:
#### A. Make major decisions based on research.
You will have to decide what to build, how to build it, and what order to build it in. Conduct research often enough that you can make those decisions based on research.

#### B. Identify major issues before you release widely.
Research doesn't just help us make decisions; it also identifies problems we didn't know we had. Conduct research often enough that you can identify those problems before you release.

#### C. Test whether you actually fixed the issues you've found.
When we try to fix issues, we can sometimes make them worse. Conduct enough testing that we can be sure our fixes have the intended effect.

#### D. Do A, B and C without slowing down development.
Research should enable, not slow, iterative development. Conduct research often enough that the product team isn't waiting. That's not always possible, but it's always our goal.

### Slow down research enough that you can::
#### E. You have enough time to address major issues before you test again.
There's no point in retesting if you'll find the same issues, again. Conduct research at a pace that allows you to fix problems before you test again.

#### F. You can include all the participants you should.
Fast past research can come at the expense of groups that are harder to recruit or take longer to interview. Research isn't complete without them. We should research at a pace that allows us to include and listen to everyone.

#### G. Your researcher and team don't burn out.
Research is intellectually, emotionally and physically consuming. Tired researchers don't do their best work. Tired teams aren't the most supportive. Conduct research at a speed that's challenging, but not overwhelming.
