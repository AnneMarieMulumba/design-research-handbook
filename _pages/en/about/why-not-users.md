A quick note about words we use to describe our design research. These word choices seem minor, but they subtly influence what we do. They also signal our maturity to our peers and job candidates.

Let’s try to say…
- *“usability testing” instead of “user testing.”* User testing implies we’re testing the users (we’re not). User testing also sounds like "user acceptance testing," which is not the same thing.

- *“people” instead of “users.”* It’s important that we remember people are more than users of our systems. And, as the saying goes “There are only two industries that call their customers users.” :slightly_smiling_face:

- *“human-centred design” instead of “user-centred design.”* If we try to avoid saying users, we should also use the alternative to “user-entered design.”

These aren’t absolute rules. There are still situations where it helps us to say “users,” “user-centered design.” But let’s be mindful of their downsides and alternatives.
