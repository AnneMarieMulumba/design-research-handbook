  * Frequency: Every week
  * Length: One hour
  * Purpose: Share updates and discuss important issues
  * Standing agenda:
    * Management updates from Colin (optimistically 10 minutes), including topics like:
      * Updates on who we're hiring
      * CDS strategy and policy discussions
    * Researcher standup (15 minutes), where each person shares:
      * What they did last week
      * What they'll do in thenext week
      * Any blockers
    * A topic of the week, which we plan on the [Trello board]({{ site.baseurl }}/kanban %}, like:
      * A retro
      * Best practices
      * Introduction to a new tool
    
* **Research community meeting on Wednesdays from 10:30-11:30 AM ET**
  * Attendees: Anyone interested in design research at CDS, not just researchers
  * Frequency: Every other week
  * Purpose: Share updates and discuss important issues
  * Agenda: A presentation or workshop by a researcher about a topic of interest to non-researchers at CDS. We track coming presentations on the [Trello board]({{ site.baseurl }}/kanban %}) See this [Google Drive folder of past presentations](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MLZZ14YNoGiWC-GagP7oW1oMbr1rJ4Yk).
  
* **One-on-ones with Colin weekly**
  * Attendees: You and Colin
  * Frequency: Every other week
  * Purpose: Touch base on your OKR progress and blockers facing your work
  * Length: Half an hour
  * Standing agenda:
    * Blockers facing your product's research
    * Progress on your OKRs
    * Whatever else you'd like to discuss
    
* **Team lunch monthly** Totally optional. We got out to lunch every month or so as a team to chat without a set agenda.

* **Team retreat quarterly** We meet for 4-5 hours toward the end of each quarter to reflect and plan for the next. See the [objectives setting process]({{ site.baseurl }}/objectives) page for more details.

### Communication channels

* [#research-team on Slack](https://gcdigital.slack.com/messages/GD4QR095W/details/) is a private channel with only researchers. We use this channel for communications relevant only to us. Remember, even though it's private from others, it can still be made public through an access to information request.
* [#designresearch on Slack](https://gcdigital.slack.com/messages/GD4QR095W/details/) is an channel for anyone interested in design research. We use this channel for any discussion the broader team might be interested in.
* We use *email* very little for communication amongst our team. Slack is a better bet.
