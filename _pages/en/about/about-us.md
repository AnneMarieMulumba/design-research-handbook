Design research is foundational to creating products, services, and systems that respond to human needs. 

### Who we are
* Colin MacArthur (head of design)
* Mithula Naik (senior design researcher)
* Hillary Lorimer (design researcher)
* Mel Banyard (design researcher)
* Martha Edwards (design researcher)

### What we do
We help product team's identify user needs that inform design and development.
We do that by:
- Planning research activities that bring clarify to the goals and problems at hand.
- Conducting field research with end users, while bringing the team along for the journey.
- Analyzing & synthesizing data, telling the story of people who use our services.
- Evaluating & testing product improvements, helping our products continue to approve.
When we do all those things well, we help our teams build products that serve people better.

### How we work with others

#### Policy
Policy helps us navigate the rules that affect research (like privacy and POR). They also help us understand the background and rationale for our work.

#### Design
Designers & researchers are two peas in a pod. Designers are our co-researchers. Researchers are their co-designers. Our findings inform their work, we discuss design solutions together, and we help evaluate what gets built.

#### Engineering and product
Engineers and product managers give us feedback on session plans, come along for research sessions and (of course) use our reserach findings. At CDS, they're key partners in research.

#### Outreach
We work with our outreach team to tell the story of how research happens and who we help.

### How we need your help

### Build things based on research, not your (or our partners') assumptions. 
- Partners may not know why we do user research. Work alongside your researcher to prove the value to them.
- Fight to make sure you have a researcher on your team.
- Question why we're prioritizing things that aren't backed by research.

### Get out of the office and talk to the people we serve, early and often.
Nothing is more powerful than being in the field and listening to the end user tell you about their needs. Or how we aren't meeting them.

### Be a research champion. Involve yourself in reserach and improve your research skills.
- Attend the bi-weekly research community meetings where we share research work and improve CDS internal capacity for design research.
- Hang out with us. Letâ€™s get coffee. :)
