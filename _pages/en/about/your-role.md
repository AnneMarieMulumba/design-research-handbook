Our job advertisement is an honest description of what we hope you'll do:

*   You conduct compelling research that drives product decisions. You lead discovery interviews, observation, and analysis of existing data. You scope research plans that will lead to both short-term and long-term successes. 
*   You bring users' voices and perspectives into the service conversation. You choose research methods that elicit the users' contexts and lived experiences. 
*   You plan and conduct usability tests, and other lightweight research methods, all in an agile environment.
*   You champion user research as a key part of the product development process for our partners. You present research to skeptical audiences and help partners build their own research capabilities.
*   You reflect on your research practice. You think about what could make your research more useful, ethical, and efficient. You're also always thinking about how to improve our products and our processes.
*   You bring fresh opinions. You're willing to challenge your product team's assumptions and speak openly to best represent the users. 

In practice, this means you:

* Serve as the researcher on the product team and provide them the data they need to make good decisions.
* Contribute to tools, teaching and templates that advance our research practice as a whole.
* Solicit and accept feedback on your work from your peers (within and outside the discpline)
* Continue to develop your own skills, by participating in training.
