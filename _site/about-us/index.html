<h2 class="page-title">About us</h2>
<p>Design research helps build services that meet human needs.</p>

<h3 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Colin MacArthur (head of design research)</li>
  <li>Mithula Naik (senior design researcher)</li>
  <li>Antoine Garcia-Suarez (design researcher)</li>
  <li>Hillary Lorimer (design researcher)</li>
  <li>Martha Edwards (design researcher)</li>
  <li>Mel Banyard (design researcher)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-we-do">What we do</h3>
<p>We help product teams identify user needs that inform design and development.
We do that by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Planning research activities that bring clarify to the goals and problems at hand.</li>
  <li>Conducting field research with end users, while bringing the team along for the journey.</li>
  <li>Analyzing &amp; synthesizing data, telling the story of people who use our services.</li>
  <li>Evaluating &amp; testing product improvements, helping our products continue to approve.
When we do all those things well, we help our teams build products that serve people better.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-we-work-with-others">How we work with others</h3>

<h4 id="policy">Policy</h4>
<p>Policy helps us navigate rules that affect research (like privacy and POR regulations). They also help us understand the background and rationale for our products.</p>

<h4 id="design">Design</h4>
<p>Designers and researchers are two peas in a pod. Designers are our co-researchers. Researchers are their co-designers. Research informs designer’s work. We discuss ideas together. And researchers help evaluate what gets built.</p>

<h4 id="engineering-and-product">Engineering and product</h4>
<p>Engineers and product managers come along for research and use our findings. At CDS, they’re key partners in research.</p>

<h4 id="outreach">Outreach</h4>
<p>We work with our outreach team to tell the story of how research happens and who we help.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-need-other-teams-to-help">How we need other teams to help</h3>

<p><strong>Build things based on research, not your (or our partners’) assumptions.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Partners may not know why we do user research. Work alongside your researcher to prove the value to them.</li>
  <li>Fight to make sure you have a researcher on your team.</li>
  <li>Question why we’re prioritizing things that aren’t backed by research.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Get out of the office and talk to the people we serve, early and often.</strong></p>

<p>Nothing is more powerful than being in the field and listening to the end user tell you about their needs. Or how we aren’t meeting them.</p>

<p><strong>Be a research champion. Involve yourself in research and improve your research skills.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend the bi-weekly research community meetings.</li>
  <li>Hang out with us. Let’s get coffee. :)</li>
</ul>
