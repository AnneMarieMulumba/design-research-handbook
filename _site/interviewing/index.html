<h2 class="page-title">Interviewing</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-interviewing">What is interviewing?</h3>
<p>Interviewing is asking people a series of questions and asking for their response.</p>

<h3 id="key-elements-of-usability-testing">Key elements of usability testing</h3>

<h3 id="1-ask-productive-questions">1. Ask productive questions.</h3>

<p><a href="https://portigal.com/seventeen-types-of-interviewing-questions/">Steve Portigal offers</a> the following palette of useful questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ask about sequence</strong> “Describe a typical workday. What do you do when you first sit down at your station?-Then what do you do next?”</li>
  <li><strong>Ask about quantity</strong> “How many files would you delete when that happens?”</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for specific examples</strong> “What is the last movie that you streamed?” – Compare this to “What movies do you stream?” The specific is easier to answer than the general and becomes a platform for follow up questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for the complete list</strong> “What are all the different apps you have installed on your smartphone?” – This requires a series of follow up questions, e.g., “What else?” because few people will be able to generate an entire list of something with some prompting.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask about relationships</strong> “How do you work with new vendors?” – This general question is especially appropriate when you don’t even know enough to ask a specific question (e.g. in comparison to the earlier example about streaming movies). Better to start general than to be presumptive with a too-specific question.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask about organizational structure</strong> “Who does that department report to?”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questions-to-probe-on-whats-unsaid">Questions to probe on what’s unsaid</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ask for clarification</strong> “When you refer to “that” you are talking about the newest server, right?”</li>
  <li><strong>Ask about code words/native language</strong> “Why do you call it the ‘Batcave?’”</li>
  <li><strong>Ask about emotional cues</strong> “Why do you laugh when you mention ‘Best Buy?’”</li>
  <li><strong>Ask why</strong> “I’ve tried to get my boss to adopt this format, but she just won’t do it-” “Why do you think she hasn’t?”</li>
  <li><strong>Probe delicately</strong> “You mentioned a difficult situation that changed your usage. Can you tell us what that situation was?”</li>
  <li><strong>Probe without presuming</strong> “Some people have very negative feelings about Twitter, while others don’t. What is your take?” – Rather than the direct “What do you think about Twitter?” or “Do you like Twitter?” this question introduces options that aren’t tied to the interviewer or the interviewee.</li>
  <li><strong>Explain to an outsider</strong> “Let’s say that I’ve just arrived here from another decade, how would you explain to me the difference between smartphones and tablets?”</li>
  <li><strong>Teach another</strong> “If you had to ask your son to operate your system, how would you explain it to him?”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-listen-to-what-people-say-the-rapport-engine">2. Listen to what people say (the “rapport engine”).</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ask your question and then stop.</li>
  <li>Maintain eye contact and open body language.</li>
  <li>Show you are listening.</li>
  <li>Ask follow-up questions.</li>
  <li>Reference earlier statements. “Earlier you said that…”</li>
  <li>Circle back when necessary. “I want to go back to what you said earlier.”</li>
  <li>Be careful about your body language (like nodding) and sounds (like “mmm-hmm”). You want to balance encouraging participants with seeming like you’re judging their statements.</li>
  <li>Be selective about when you talk about yourself or your opinions. Remember, this interview is about them, not you.</li>
  <li>Avoiding interrupting. Let there be a little bit of silence.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-manage-the-flow">3. Manage the flow.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Progress between phases:</li>
  <li>Warming up</li>
  <li>Establishing the basics</li>
  <li>Diving deeper</li>
  <li>Key questions</li>
  <li>Summing up</li>
  <li>Reflecting and verifying</li>
  <li>When you’re changing topic, say so.</li>
  <li>Let participants be winding and pick up disparate threads later.</li>
  <li>Let participants know what your goal or “arc” for the session is.</li>
  <li>Give people an out if they get uncomfortable.</li>
  <li>Give people an opportunity to ask their own questions as well. Those questions can be revealing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-dont-only-ask-questions">4. Don’t only ask questions.</h3>

<p><em>Instead, ask people to:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete tasks.</li>
  <li>Get reactions to a sketch, website or objects.</li>
  <li>Sequence cards or sticky notes that represent their experience.</li>
  <li>Write down a few key points.</li>
  <li>If you can watch them complete a task.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-look-for-patterns-not-outliers">5. Look for patterns, not outliers.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use as close to verbatim notes as you can.</li>
  <li>Focus on what you heard most frequently, not what was most interesting.</li>
  <li>Talk about the diversity of answers, not just the most memorable one.</li>
  <li>Come to conclusions, then analyze again.</li>
  <li>Don’t analyze alone.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tips-for-conducting-interviews-at-cds">Tips for conducting interviews at CDS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow our <a href="/privacy">guidelines for respecting participants’ privacy</a>. Work with our policy team to create an ATIP-approved consent form before you get started. Speak to the policy analyst on your product team or ask Colin for more help.</li>
  <li>Interviewing, as part of user research, is generally exempt from <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/public-opinion-research-government.html#toc3">Government of Canada Public Opinion Research regulation</a>. But follow <a href="/por">our POR tips</a> to steer clear of potential problems.</li>
  <li>You can use our <a href="/research-kit">equipment</a> and/or <a href="/research-room">listening room</a> for interviews.</li>
</ul>
